This is a work-in-progress attempt at teaching myself cryptography and the C language at the same time. I would recommend against even playing with it at home at this stage, until I have time to make some improvements, and it obviously goes without saying that even if you can get it to encrypt anything at all, do not rely on this or any homespun ciphers to protect any of your data. RC5 is known to be insecure.
